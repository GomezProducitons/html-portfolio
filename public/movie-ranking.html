<h3>Resident Evil (2002)</h3>
<p>My favorit movie by far. This film lead me to the video game series.<br /> 
   The first game was also legendary and I fell in love the saga.

<h3>Spiderman 2 (2004)</h3>
<p> This movie really was a part of my childhood and funny enough <br />
    I discovered the video game series as well. It seemed back then<br />
    evey movie had a video game that was based on the same story.<br />
</p>
<h3>Deadpool 2 (2018)</h3>
<p>I orginally watched this movie back in highschool. It was during<br />
    so it became even more memorable. Looking back I had a super chill<br />
    highschool teacher at the time. It was during an election class <br />
    which I forgot what it was lol. I remember I watched Deadpool <br />
    and thats about it.<br />
